# FireProject


The goal of this project is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the occurrence and intensity of wildfires in Europe based on Copernicus climate data. The project will use various climate variables, such as temperature, precipitation, location and dry periods as input features for the RNN model. The output will be a forecast of fire risk and severity for different regions and time periods. The project aims to contribute to the mitigation and adaptation efforts of the European countries in the face of climate change and its impacts.
